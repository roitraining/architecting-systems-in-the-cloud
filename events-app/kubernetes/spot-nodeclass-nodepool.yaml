# Note: EKS Auto Mode manages NodePools automatically
# This file documents the desired configuration
# 
# For EKS Auto Mode, you cannot create custom NodePools via kubectl
# Instead, use pod-level nodeSelectors and tolerations to influence scheduling
#
# The deployments have been configured to prefer:
# - Spot instances (via toleration)
# - C4, C5, or M family instances (via nodeSelector)
#
# EKS Auto Mode will automatically provision appropriate nodes based on pod requirements
